# Flamingo ðŸ¦©
Flamingo is a framework to build Telegram bots using .NET as easy as possible!

## Install
**Flamingo** is available in [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Flamingo)

_âš  Please consider this as a beta version yet!_

## How to use
Below there are some sources you can use

### Get Started
_After installing Flamingo through Nuget package manager, you can use it like example below:_

#### 1- First of all Create an instance of `FlamingoCore` class into your program main method

```cs
static async Task Main()
{
    var flamingo = await new FlamingoCore()
}
```

#### 2- Now is the time to initialize your bot. in order to do that you need a bot token
(You can make a new bot and get api token for it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

- bot token is something like: `123443536:Akhkhpoue_DLkhejbdkeaiDHJKFkjbjs_D`
- Use method InitBot to initialize the bot like below:
```cs
// Pass your bot token to the method
await flamingo.InitBot("123443536:Akhkhpoue_DLkhejbdkeaiDHJKFkjbjs_D")
```

_Remember, most of this library methods are `async`. meaning that you should `await` them and use them in an async function ( like `Main()` here )_


#### 3- Let's make our first handler. handlers are what you handle and process inComing updates the way you like.
- To quickly build a handler we Use `SimpleInComing<T>`. where T is update type like messages, callback queries, inline queries and etc.
- To make handler for incoming messages, The `T` is `Message` ( like `SimpleInComing<Message>` )

#### 4- Every incoming handler has 2 important parts: **Filter** and **Callback function**
- Filters job is obvious: filter incoming updates to receive exact update you want
- Callback function: this function is where you decide how to process incoming update that passed filters. 

### Filters
Here we use two filters: 
- ChatTypeFilter: to make sure the update is coming from private chat
- CommandFilter: to handle specified bot command like `/start` 
- To Combine filters we bitwise operator `&` Meaning `AND`!

Your filters should be like below:
```cs
var chatFilter = new ChatTypeFilter<Message>(FlamingoChatType.Private);

var commandFilter new CommandFilter("start");
```
Later we'll combine them!

### Callback function
Callback function should take an `ICondiment<Message>` which contain everything you need to handle your updates, and should return a boolean as Task ( awaitable method )

Method structure should be like this:
```cs
private static async Task<bool> CallbackFunc(ICondiment<Message> cdmt)
{
    await cdmt.ReplyText("Just started!");
    return true;
}
```
We decided to reply to use command with a text message: `"Just started!"`. 

`cdmt.ReplyText()` dose that for us. it's an extension method of `ICondiment<Message>`


#### 5- Now that our filters and callback function is ready, we should pass them to handler instance (3)
```cs
var startHandler = new SimpleInComing<Message>(CallbackFunc,
    chatFilter & commandFilter);
``` 
As you see we combined two filters with &, meaning both of them should pass!

#### 6- Now add your handler to the Flamingo
```cs
flamingo.AddInComing(startHandler);
```

#### 7- Start listening to updates
```cs
await flamingo.Fly();
```

Your `Program.cs` file should be like below:
```cs
using Flamingo;
using Flamingo.Condiments;
using Flamingo.Condiments.Extensions;
using Flamingo.Filters.MessageFilters;
using Flamingo.Filters.SharedFilters;
using Flamingo.Fishes.InComingFishes.SimpleInComings;
using Flamingo.Helpers.Types.Enums;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Telegram.Bot.Types;

namespace SimpleFlamingo
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main()
        {
            var flamingo = new FlamingoCore();

            await flamingo.InitBot("1820608649:AAF_rimZO_y_RlYnTX2WnifXldL1GiIcxt4");

            var chatFilter = new ChatTypeFilter<Message>(FlamingoChatType.Private);

            var commandFilter = new CommandFilter("start");

            var startHandler = new SimpleInComing<Message>(CallbackFunc,
                chatFilter & commandFilter);

            flamingo.AddInComing(startHandler);

            await flamingo.Fly();
        }

        private static async Task<bool> CallbackFunc(ICondiment<Message> cdmt)
        {
            await cdmt.ReplyText("Just started!");
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 8- Send command `/start` to your bot and see what happens.

#### You can write all of these using Attributes even more quicker
